# FoldAR

### Inspiration

Proteins have a complex 3D structure which is important for medical researchers to thoroughly understand in order to develop effective drugs and save lives. In particular, the 3D structure of new chimeric proteins (the result of fusing together parts from separate proteins) may have emergent properties which are not obvious without close visual inspection. Medical researchers need a way to visualize novel proteins in a natural 3-dimensional environment.

### What it does

FoldAR runs on the Lenovo ThinkReality Smartglasses, which connects to smartphones to provide a convenient way to interact with a 3D augmented reality environment. The phone interface has a textfield to allow for keyboard input, which can be either the name of a known protein (e.g. insulin) or an amino acid sequence which can generate an entirely new protein! We developed an API which interfaces with AlphaFold to return the 3D structure of a protein upon entering the amino acid sequence.
